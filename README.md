programming web project

so, this project that i created is to fulfill my project study about web programming.

files included:
  - 4 HTML files
  - 10 images for the content of the web
  - 1 CSS file for general stylesheet
  
all files are connected with hyperlinks each file located at the top of the pages.

"cat stuff" pages, there is a list of popular types of cat, each one has photo of them, and they are connected to wikipedia if you click on the photo of each cat.

if i am not mistaken, it should cover all the requirements of this project.

thank you very much for checking this files.
